Test that --mount-claude-config=false shows initial Claude setup.

Flow:
1. Start session with --mount-claude-config=false
2. Verify initial Claude setup prompts appear
3. Verify we see configuration questions (text style, bypass permissions)
4. Exit session

Expected:
- Initial Claude setup prompts appear
- Configuration questions are shown
- No pre-configured Claude environment
