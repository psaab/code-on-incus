"""
Test file persistence after container exits.

Flow:
1. Start shell
2. Ask Claude to write "IM HERE" to HELLO.md
3. Exit container
4. Verify file exists in workspace with correct content
5. Clean up file

Expected:
- Files created in container persist in workspace after exit
- File content is correct
