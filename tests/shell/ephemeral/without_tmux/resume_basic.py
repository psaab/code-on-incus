"""
Test basic session resume functionality.

Flow:
1. Start first session
2. Exit session (session data should be saved)
3. Resume session with --resume flag
4. Verify no credential prompts appear
5. Verify Claude responds to new prompts

Expected:
- Session data is saved after first session
- Resume works without credential prompts
- Can interact with Claude after resume
