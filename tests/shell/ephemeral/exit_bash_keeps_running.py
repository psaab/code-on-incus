"""
Test for coi shell - exit bash keeps container running.

Tests the behavior:
1. Start fake-claude in ephemeral mode
2. Exit claude to bash
3. Exit bash (not poweroff)
4. Verify container is still running
5. Verify can attach with coi attach --bash
6. Cleanup: kill the container

Expected:
- Exiting bash (not poweroff) keeps container running
- coi attach --bash works to reconnect
- Container can be killed for cleanup
