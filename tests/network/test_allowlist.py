Integration tests for network allowlist mode.

Tests the domain allowlisting feature with DNS resolution and IP-based filtering.

NOTE: These tests require config file support, which is currently tested manually.
The tests below are placeholders for future automated testing once we have
proper config file injection support in the test framework.
