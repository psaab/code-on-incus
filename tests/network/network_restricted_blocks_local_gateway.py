Test for network isolation - restricted mode blocks local gateway.

Tests that:
1. Container in restricted mode (default) cannot reach local gateway
2. Works regardless of what private network range the host uses
3. Dynamically discovers the gateway IP

Note: This test requires OVN networking (now configured in CI).
