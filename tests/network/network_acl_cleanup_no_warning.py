"""
Test for network ACL cleanup - no warning when poweroff is used.

Tests that:
1. Container with network ACL (restricted/allowlist mode) starts successfully
2. When container is stopped and then shutdown, ACL is cleaned up silently
3. No "failed to delete network ACL" warning appears
4. ACL is properly removed from Incus

This test validates the fix for issue #67 where ACL deletion would fail with
"exit status 1" because it was attempted while the ACL was still attached to
the container's network device. The fix deletes the container first (which
detaches the ACL), then deletes the ACL.
