"""
Test for coi build - DNS auto-fix functionality.

Tests that:
1. When DNS is misconfigured (127.0.0.53 stub resolver), build auto-detects and fixes it
2. Build completes successfully with auto-fix
3. Warning message is displayed about the DNS misconfiguration

This test temporarily modifies the Incus network configuration to simulate
the DNS misconfiguration that occurs on Ubuntu systems with systemd-resolved.

Note: This test only runs in bridge network environment because OVN networks
use different DNS mechanisms that can't be easily broken with raw.dnsmasq.
The DNS auto-fix functionality is sufficiently tested in bridge environment.
