# CHANGELOG

## 0.4.0 (2026-01-14)

Add comprehensive network isolation with domain allowlisting and IP-based filtering, enabling high-security environments where containers can only communicate with approved domains.

### Features
- [Feature] Domain allowlisting mode - Restrict container network access to only approved domains
- [Feature] DNS resolution with automatic IP refresh (every 30 minutes by default)
- [Feature] IP caching for DNS failure resilience and container restarts
- [Feature] Background goroutine for periodic IP refresh without container restart
- [Feature] Per-profile domain allowlists for different security contexts

### Enhancements
- [Enhancement] New `allowlist` network mode alongside existing `restricted` and `open` modes
- [Enhancement] Always block RFC1918 private networks in allowlist mode
- [Enhancement] Persistent IP cache at `~/.coi/network-cache/<container>.json`
- [Enhancement] Graceful DNS failure handling with last-known-good IPs
- [Enhancement] Comprehensive logging for DNS resolution and IP refresh operations
- [Enhancement] Dynamic ACL recreation for IP updates without container restart

### Configuration
- `network.mode = "allowlist"` - Enable domain allowlisting
- `network.allowed_domains = ["github.com", "api.anthropic.com"]` - List of allowed domains
- `network.refresh_interval_minutes = 30` - IP refresh interval (default: 30, 0 to disable)

### Documentation
- [Documentation] Updated README.md with network isolation modes and configuration
- [Documentation] Added DNS failure handling and IP refresh behavior explanations
- [Documentation] Documented security limitations and best practices
- [Documentation] Simplified networking documentation for better accessibility

### Technical Details
Allowlist implementation:
- **DNS Resolution**: Resolves domains to IPv4 addresses on container start
- **ACL Structure**: Default-deny with explicit allow rules for resolved IPs
- **IP Refresh**: Background goroutine checks for IP changes every 30 minutes
- **Cache Format**: JSON file with domain-to-IPs mapping and last update timestamp
- **Graceful Degradation**: Uses cached IPs on DNS failures, only fails if no IPs ever resolved
- **ACL Update**: Full ACL recreation (delete + create + reapply) for IP changes (~100ms network interruption)

### New Files
- `internal/network/cache.go` - IP cache persistence manager
- `internal/network/resolver.go` - DNS resolver with caching and fallback
- `tests/network/test_allowlist.py` - Integration test framework for allowlist mode

### Modified Files
- `internal/config/config.go` - Added `AllowedDomains`, `RefreshIntervalMinutes`, `NetworkModeAllowlist`
- `internal/network/acl.go` - Added `CreateAllowlist()`, `buildAllowlistRules()`, `RecreateWithNewIPs()`
- `internal/network/manager.go` - Added `setupAllowlist()`, `startRefresher()`, `stopRefresher()`, `refreshAllowedIPs()`
- `README.md` - Added network isolation section with all three modes
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Increased storage pool from 5GiB to 15GiB
- `tests/meta/installation_smoke_test.py` - Added retry logic for transient network issues

## 0.3.2 (2026-01-14)

Add network isolation to prevent containers from accessing local/internal networks while allowing full internet access for development workflows.

### Features
- [Feature] Network isolation - Block container access to private networks (RFC1918) and cloud metadata endpoints by default
- [Feature] `--network` flag to control network mode: `restricted` (default) or `open`
- [Feature] Dynamic gateway discovery in tests to work on any network configuration
- [Feature] Comprehensive network isolation test suite (6 tests covering restricted/open modes)

### Bug Fixes
- [Fix] Dummy image build - Fix `buildCustom()` to push dummy file to container, enabling test image builds
- [Fix] Incus ACL configuration - Add explicit `egress action=allow` rule to prevent default deny behavior

### Enhancements
- [Enhancement] Network documentation - Add comprehensive `NETWORK.md` with security model, configuration, and testing guide
- [Enhancement] Two-step ACL application - Use `device override` followed by `device set` for proper ACL attachment
- [Enhancement] Integration tests use backgrounded containers for consistency and reliability
- [Enhancement] README updated with network isolation section and security information

### Technical Details
Network isolation implementation:
- **Restricted mode (default)**: Blocks RFC1918 ranges (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16) and cloud metadata (169.254.0.0/16), allows all public internet
- **Open mode**: No restrictions (previous behavior)
- **Implementation**: Incus network ACLs applied at container network interface level
- **Tests**: 6 integration tests validate blocking private networks, metadata endpoints, and local gateway while allowing internet access

## 0.3.1 (2026-01-13)

Re-release of 0.3.0 with proper GitHub release automation.

## 0.3.0 (2026-01-13)

### Features
- [Feature] Add `--format=json` flag to `coi list` command for machine-readable output
- [Feature] Add `--format=raw` flag to `coi container exec --capture` for raw stdout output (exit code via $?)

### Bug Fixes

### Enhancements
- [Enhancement] Enable programmatic integration between coi and claude_yard projects
- [Enhancement] Add 5 integration tests for new output formats (3 for list, 2 for exec)
- [Enhancement] Add integration test for power management commands without sudo
- [Enhancement] Update README with --format flag documentation and examples

- [Enhancement] **Python linting with ruff** - Added ruff linter (Python equivalent of rubocop) to CI, auto-fixed 68 issues, formatted 166 test files for consistency
- [Enhancement] **CI tests now run all attach tests** - Removed skipif decorators after fixing tmux persistence, all tests pass in CI

### Changes
- [Change] Rename images from `claudeyard-*` to `coi-*` for consistency
- [Change] **Session creation pattern** - Changed from `tmux new-session` (single command) to `tmux new-session -d` + `tmux attach` (two-step pattern) for better detach/reattach support
