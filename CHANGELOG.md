# CHANGELOG

## 0.3.1 (2026-01-13)

Re-release of 0.3.0 with proper GitHub release automation.

## 0.3.0 (2026-01-13)

Add machine-readable output formats to enable programmatic integration with claude_yard Ruby project.

### Features
- [Feature] Add `--format=json` flag to `coi list` command for machine-readable output
- [Feature] Add `--format=raw` flag to `coi container exec --capture` for raw stdout output (exit code via $?)

### Bug Fixes
- [Fix] Power management permissions - Add wrapper scripts for shutdown/poweroff/reboot commands to work without sudo prefix (uses passwordless sudo internally)

### Enhancements
- [Enhancement] Enable programmatic integration between coi and claude_yard projects
- [Enhancement] Add 5 integration tests for new output formats (3 for list, 2 for exec)
- [Enhancement] Add integration test for power management commands without sudo
- [Enhancement] Update README with --format flag documentation and examples
- [Enhancement] Normalize all "fake-claude" references to "dummy" throughout codebase (tests, docs, scripts)
- [Enhancement] Remove FAQ.md - content no longer relevant after refactoring

## 0.2.0 (2026-01-03)

Major internal refactoring to make coi CLI-agnostic (zero breaking changes). Enables future support for tools beyond Claude Code (e.g., Aider, Cursor). Includes bug fixes for persistent containers, slot allocation, and CI improvements.

### Features
- [Feature] Add `shutdown` command for graceful container shutdown (separate from `kill`)
- [Feature] Add `attach` command to attach to running sessions
- [Feature] Add `images` command to list available Incus images
- [Feature] Add `version` command for displaying version information
- [Feature] Add GitHub Actions workflow for automated releases with pre-built binaries
- [Feature] Add automatic `~/.claude` config mounting (enabled by default)
- [Feature] Add CHANGELOG.md for version history tracking
- [Feature] Add one-shot installer script (`install.sh`)

### Refactoring (Internal API - Non-Breaking)
- [Refactor] Rename functions: `runClaude()` → `runCLI()`, `runClaudeInTmux()` → `runCLIInTmux()`, `GetClaudeSessionID()` → `GetCLISessionID()`, `setupClaudeConfig()` → `setupCLIConfig()`
- [Refactor] Rename variables: `claudeBinary` → `cliBinary`, `claudeCmd` → `cliCmd`, `claudeDir` → `stateDir`, `claudePath` → `statePath`, `claudeJsonPath` → `stateConfigPath`
- [Refactor] Rename struct fields: `ClaudeConfigPath` → `CLIConfigPath`
- [Refactor] Rename test infrastructure: "fake-claude" → "dummy", `COI_USE_TEST_CLAUDE` → `COI_USE_DUMMY`
- [Refactor] Update all internal documentation to use generic "CLI tool" terminology

### Bug Fixes
- [Fix] Persistent container filesystem persistence - Files now survive container stop/start
- [Fix] Resume flag inheritance - `--resume` properly inherits persistent/privileged flags from session metadata
- [Fix] Slot allocator race condition - Improved slot allocation logic to prevent conflicts
- [Fix] Environment variable passing in `run` command - Variables now properly passed to containers
- [Fix] Attach command container detection - Improved reliability of attach operations
- [Fix] CI networking issues - Better timeout handling (180s) and diagnostics for slower environments
- [Fix] Test suite stability - Various fixes to make tests more reliable and deterministic
- [Fix] Persistent container indicator in `coi list` - Shows "(persistent)" label correctly
- [Fix] CI cache key updated to use `testdata/dummy/**` pattern
- [Fix] Documentation inconsistencies between README and actual implementation
- [Fix] **Tmux server persistence in CI** - Explicitly start tmux server before session operations; ensures sessions work in CI and new containers
- [Fix] **Test isolation for parallel execution** - Fixed auto_attach_single_session test to use --slot flag, preventing conflicts when other sessions are running

### Enhancements
- [Enhancement] Update image builder to use `dummy` instead of `test-claude`
- [Enhancement] Improve CI networking with HTTP/HTTPS fallback tests
- [Enhancement] Add backwards-compatible test fixtures (`fake_claude_path` → `dummy_path`)
- [Enhancement] Update dummy script with generic terminology and documentation
- [Enhancement] Improve README with complete command documentation (attach, images, version, shutdown)
- [Enhancement] Update configuration examples with `mount_claude_config` option
- [Enhancement] Document `--storage` flag in README
- [Enhancement] Add refactoring documentation (CLAUDE_REFERENCES_ANALYSIS.md, REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md, REFACTORING_PHASE2.md)
- [Enhancement] Add "See Also" section in README with links to documentation
- [Enhancement] **Tmux architecture** - Sessions created detached then attached separately; tmux server explicitly started before operations for reliability
- [Enhancement] **Python linting with ruff** - Added ruff linter (Python equivalent of rubocop) to CI, auto-fixed 68 issues, formatted 166 test files for consistency
- [Enhancement] **CI tests now run all attach tests** - Removed skipif decorators after fixing tmux persistence, all tests pass in CI

### Changes
- [Change] Rename images from `claudeyard-*` to `coi-*` for consistency
- [Change] **Session creation pattern** - Changed from `tmux new-session` (single command) to `tmux new-session -d` + `tmux attach` (two-step pattern) for better detach/reattach support
