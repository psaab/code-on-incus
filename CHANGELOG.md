# CHANGELOG

## 0.6.0 (Unreleased)

### Bug Fixes

- [Bug Fix] **Network ACL support detection** - Fixed `coi shell` failing with "Invalid device option 'security.acls'" error on standard Incus bridge networks. The tool now detects whether the network supports ACLs (requires OVN) and provides a clear error message with remediation steps instead of a cryptic failure. Users on standard bridge networks are guided to either use `--network=open` or configure OVN networking. (#63)

### Features

- [Feature] **Automatic OVN host routing** - COI now automatically configures host routes to OVN networks, allowing you to access container services (web servers, databases, APIs) directly from your host machine. When starting a container on an OVN network, COI detects the network type, extracts the OVN subnet and uplink IP, and adds the necessary routing rule. If sudo access is unavailable, COI displays the exact command needed: `sudo ip route add <subnet> via <uplink-ip> dev <bridge>`. This eliminates the "Connection refused" or "No route to host" errors when trying to curl/access services running in containers with network isolation (restricted/allowlist modes). Works automatically with all OVN-based networks - no configuration required. (#81)
- [Feature] **Automatic Docker/nested container support** - COI now automatically enables Docker and container nesting support on all containers by setting `security.nesting=true`, `security.syscalls.intercept.mknod=true`, and `security.syscalls.intercept.setxattr=true`. This eliminates the "unable to start container process: error during container init: open sysctl net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start file: reopen fd 8: permission denied" error when running Docker inside Incus containers. No configuration required - Docker just works out of the box.
- [Feature] **Automatic Colima/Lima environment detection** - COI now automatically detects when running inside a Colima or Lima VM and disables UID shifting. These VMs already handle UID mapping at the VM level via virtiofs, making Incus's `shift=true` unnecessary and problematic. Detection checks for virtiofs mounts in `/proc/mounts` and the `lima` user. Users no longer need to manually configure `disable_shift` option.
- [Feature] **Manual UID shift override** - Added `disable_shift` config option for manual control in edge cases: `[incus]` `disable_shift = true` in `~/.config/coi/config.toml`. The auto-detection works in most cases, but this option allows manual override if needed.
- [Feature] Add `coi persist` command to convert ephemeral sessions to persistent - Allows converting running ephemeral containers to persistent mode, preventing automatic deletion when stopped. Supports `--all` flag to persist all containers and `--force` to skip confirmations. Use `coi list` to verify persistence mode.
- [Feature] **Display IPv4 addresses in `coi list`** - The `coi list` command now shows the IPv4 address (eth0) for running containers, making it easy to access exposed web servers and services. The IPv4 field appears in both text and JSON output formats. Stopped containers do not display an IP address since they have no network connectivity. (#66)

### Bug Fixes

- [Bug Fix] **Exotic terminal type support** - Fixed tmux failing with "missing or unsuitable terminal" error when using modern terminals like Ghostty, WezTerm, Alacritty, or Kitty. These terminals set TERM to values (e.g., `xterm-ghostty`) that don't exist in container terminfo databases. Added automatic mapping to `xterm-256color` while preserving standard terminal types unchanged. Applies to both environment TERM and `-e TERM=...` flag. (#53)

### Technical Details

OVN host routing:
- **Automatic Detection**: Checks if container's network is OVN type (vs standard bridge)
- **Route Configuration**: Extracts OVN subnet (from `ipv4.address`), OVN uplink IP (from `volatile.network.ipv4.address`), and uplink bridge name (from `network` config)
- **Key Insight**: Routes via OVN's uplink IP on the bridge (e.g., `10.47.62.100`) NOT the bridge's gateway IP (e.g., `10.47.62.1`). The OVN uplink IP acts as the gateway to the OVN network.
- **Graceful Degradation**: If route already exists, skips addition. If sudo fails, shows helpful command instead of failing container startup
- **Auto-healing**: Automatically checks and re-adds route on every container start, so routes are restored after reboot (requires sudo)
- **IP Stability**: OVN uplink IP is relatively stable (changes only if OVN network is deleted/recreated)
- **Persistence Options**: README documents three approaches for fully automatic routing after reboot: passwordless sudo (recommended for dev), systemd service, or netplan configuration
- **Clear Messaging**: Improved messages explain OVN routing is independent of network mode and works in open/restricted/allowlist modes
- **Use Case**: Essential for development workflows where users run web servers (Rails, Django, Node), databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL), or APIs in containers and need to access them from host browsers, database clients, or API testing tools
- **CI Integration**: GitHub Actions CI now properly configures OVN routing, enabling integration tests for network isolation features

Docker/nested container support:
- **Automatic Configuration**: All containers automatically receive Docker support flags on launch
- **Security Flags**: Three flags are set: `security.nesting=true` (enables nested containerization), `security.syscalls.intercept.mknod=true` (safe device node creation), `security.syscalls.intercept.setxattr=true` (safe filesystem attribute handling)
- **Security Model**: Incus's syscall interception provides defense-in-depth - even if a process escapes a Docker container, it remains within the isolated Incus container
- **Use Case**: Safe for development/testing environments (COI's primary use case) where you control the workloads running inside containers
- **Technical Root Cause**: Docker (runc) needs to access and reopen file descriptors for network-related sysctls when creating network namespaces. Without nesting flags, runc cannot perform these operations, resulting in "permission denied" errors when accessing `net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start`

Colima/Lima detection:
- **Auto-detection**: Checks `/proc/mounts` for virtiofs filesystem (characteristic of Lima VMs)
- **Fallback check**: Verifies if running as `lima` user (Lima VM default user)
- **Logging**: Clearly indicates when auto-detection activates vs manual configuration
- **Override**: Manual `disable_shift = true` config takes precedence over auto-detection

This prevents the error: `Error: Failed to start device "workspace": Required idmapping abilities not available` when running COI inside Colima/Lima VMs on macOS.

### Testing

- [Testing] Added Docker integration tests - Three test scenarios: (1) verify Docker nesting flags are automatically enabled on container launch, (2) verify Docker actually works inside containers without network namespace errors, (3) verify Docker fails with a clear error when required nesting flags are not enabled (regression test) (tests/docker/ directory).
- [Testing] Added integration tests for `coi persist` command - Five test scenarios covering basic operation, bulk operations, state verification, and error handling (tests/persist/ directory).
- [Testing] Added comprehensive terminal sanitization tests - Unit tests, integration tests with real tmux sessions, and CI end-to-end tests that verify exotic terminal types work correctly in containers.
- [Testing] Added integration tests for IPv4 display in `coi list` - Three test scenarios covering running containers showing IPv4, stopped containers not showing IPv4, and JSON format including the ipv4 field (tests/list/ directory).


## 0.5.2 (2026-01-19)

### Bug Fixes

- [Bug Fix] Fix version mismatch in released binaries - Version 0.5.1 was incorrectly showing as 0.5.0 due to hardcoded version string in source code.

### Enhancements

- [Enhancement] Implement dynamic version injection via ldflags during build - Version is now automatically set from git tags at build time instead of being hardcoded in source code.
- [Enhancement] Add version verification step in GitHub Actions release workflow - Build process now validates that the binary version matches the git tag before creating releases, preventing future version mismatches.
- [Enhancement] Update Makefile to inject version from git tags using `git describe --tags --always --dirty`, with fallback to "dev" for local builds without tags.

### Technical Details

Version injection implementation:
- **Source code**: Changed `Version` from `const` to `var` with default value "dev" in `internal/cli/root.go`
- **Build system**: Added `VERSION` variable and `LDFLAGS` to Makefile for dynamic version injection
- **Release workflow**: Pass `VERSION` environment variable to build step and verify binary version matches expected tag
- **Verification**: Release workflow now extracts version from built binary and compares against git tag, failing build on mismatch

## 0.5.1 (2026-01-17)

### Features

- [Feature] Auto-detect and fix DNS misconfiguration during image build. On Ubuntu systems with systemd-resolved, containers may receive `127.0.0.53` as their DNS server, which doesn't work inside containers. COI now automatically detects this issue and injects working public DNS servers (8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4, 1.1.1.1) to unblock the build process.
- [Feature] Built images now include conditional DNS fix that activates only when DNS is misconfigured, ensuring containers work regardless of host Incus network configuration.
- [Feature] Allowlist mode now supports raw IPv4 addresses in addition to domain names. Users can add entries like `8.8.8.8` directly to `allowed_domains` without needing to resolve them.

### Bug Fixes

- [Bug Fix] Suppress spurious "Error: The instance is already stopped" message during successful image builds. The error was appearing during cleanup when the container was already stopped by the imaging process. Now checks if container is running before attempting to stop it.
- [Bug Fix] Fix spurious "Error: The instance is already stopped" message during `coi run --persistent` cleanup. When a persistent container stopped itself after command completion, the cleanup tried to stop it again, causing spurious errors. Now checks if container is running before attempting to stop it.
- [Bug Fix] Fix potential race condition in `coi shutdown` where force-kill could attempt to stop an already-stopped container if graceful shutdown completed during the timeout window. Now checks if container is still running before attempting force-kill.

### Documentation

- [Docs] Added Troubleshooting section to README with DNS issues documentation and permanent fix instructions.

### Testing

- [Testing] Added integration test `tests/build/no_spurious_errors.py` to verify no spurious errors appear during successful builds
- [Testing] Added integration test `tests/run/run_persistent_no_spurious_errors.py` to verify no spurious errors during persistent run cleanup
- [Testing] Added integration test `tests/shutdown/shutdown_no_spurious_errors.py` to verify no spurious errors during shutdown with timeout
- [Testing] Added integration test `tests/build/build_dns_autofix.py` to verify DNS auto-fix works during builds with misconfigured DNS
- [Testing] Added unit test `internal/network/resolver_test.go` for raw IPv4 address support in allowlist mode

## 0.5.0 (2026-01-15)

**Major architectural refactoring to support multiple AI coding tools**

This release introduces a comprehensive tool abstraction layer that allows code-on-incus to support multiple AI coding assistants beyond Claude Code. The refactoring was completed in three phases (Phase 1-3) with minimal user-facing changes.

### Breaking Changes
